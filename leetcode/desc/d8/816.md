<div><p>We had some 2-dimensional coordinates, like <code>"(1, 3)"</code> or <code>"(2, 0.5)"</code>.&nbsp; Then, we removed&nbsp;all commas, decimal points, and spaces, and ended up with the string&nbsp;<code>S</code>.&nbsp; Return a list of strings representing&nbsp;all possibilities for what our original coordinates could have been.</p>

<p>Our original representation never had extraneous zeroes, so we never started with numbers like "00", "0.0", "0.00", "1.0", "001", "00.01", or any other number that can be represented with&nbsp;less digits.&nbsp; Also, a decimal point within a number never occurs without at least one digit occuring before it, so we never started with numbers like ".1".</p>

<p>The final answer list can be returned in any order.&nbsp; Also note that all coordinates in the final answer&nbsp;have exactly one space between them (occurring after the comma.)</p>

<pre><strong>Example 1:</strong>
<strong>Input:</strong> "(123)"
<strong>Output:</strong> ["(1, 23)", "(12, 3)", "(1.2, 3)", "(1, 2.3)"]
</pre>

<pre><strong>Example 2:</strong>
<strong>Input:</strong> "(00011)"
<strong>Output:</strong> &nbsp;["(0.001, 1)", "(0, 0.011)"]
<strong>Explanation:</strong> 
0.0, 00, 0001 or 00.01 are not allowed.
</pre>

<pre><strong>Example 3:</strong>
<strong>Input:</strong> "(0123)"
<strong>Output:</strong> ["(0, 123)", "(0, 12.3)", "(0, 1.23)", "(0.1, 23)", "(0.1, 2.3)", "(0.12, 3)"]
</pre>

<pre><strong>Example 4:</strong>
<strong>Input:</strong> "(100)"
<strong>Output:</strong> [(10, 0)]
<strong>Explanation:</strong> 
1.0 is not allowed.
</pre>

	<li><code>S[0]</code> = "(", <code>S[S.length - 1]</code> = ")", and the other elements in <code>S</code> are digits.</li>
