<div><p>Suppose Andy and Doris want to choose a restaurant for dinner, and they both have a list of favorite restaurants represented by strings.</p>

<p>You need to help them find out their <b>common interest</b> with the <b>least list index sum</b>. If there is a choice tie between answers, output all of them with no order requirement. You could assume there always exists an answer.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> list1 = ["Shogun","Tapioca Express","Burger King","KFC"], list2 = ["Piatti","The Grill at Torrey Pines","Hungry Hunter Steakhouse","Shogun"]

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> list1 = ["Shogun","Tapioca Express","Burger King","KFC"], list2 = ["KFC","Shogun","Burger King"]
<strong>Output:</strong> ["Shogun"]
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The restaurant they both like and have the least index sum is "Shogun" with index sum 1 (0+1).
</pre>

<p><strong>Example 3:</strong></p>

	<li><code>1 &lt;= list1[i].length, list2[i].length &lt;= 30</code></li>
	<li><code>list1[i]</code> and <code>list2[i]</code> consist of spaces <code>' '</code> and English letters.</li>
	<li>All the stings of <code>list1</code> are <strong>unique</strong>.</li>
	<li>All the stings of <code>list2</code>&nbsp;are <strong>unique</strong>.</li>
