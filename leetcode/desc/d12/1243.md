<div><p>Given an initial array <code>arr</code>, every day you produce a new array using the array of the previous day.</p>

<p>On the <code>i</code>-th day, you do the following operations on the array of day&nbsp;<code>i-1</code>&nbsp;to produce the array of day <code>i</code>:</p>

<ol>
	<li>If an element is smaller than both its left neighbor and its right neighbor, then this element is incremented.</li>
	<li>If an element is bigger than both its left neighbor and its right neighbor, then this element is decremented.</li>
	<li>The first&nbsp;and last elements never change.</li>
</ol>

<p>After some days, the array does not change. Return that final array.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> arr = [6,2,3,4]
<strong>Output:</strong> [6,3,3,4]
<strong>Explanation: </strong>
On the first day, the array is changed from [6,2,3,4] to [6,3,3,4].
No more operations can be done to this array.
</pre>

<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> arr = [1,6,3,4,3,5]
<strong>Output:</strong> [1,4,4,4,4,5]
<strong>Explanation: </strong>
On the first day, the array is changed from [1,6,3,4,3,5] to [1,5,4,3,4,5].
On the second day, the array is changed from [1,5,4,3,4,5] to [1,4,4,4,4,5].
No more operations can be done to this array.
</pre>

<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>3 &lt;= arr.length &lt;= 100</code></li>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= arr[i] &lt;= 100</code></li>
</ul>
