You are a hiker preparing for an upcoming hike. You are given `heights`, a 2D array of size `rows x columns`, where `heights[row][col]` represents the height of cell `(row, col)`. You are situated in the top-left cell, `(0, 0)`, and you hope to travel to the bottom-right cell, `(rows-1, columns-1)` (i.e., **0-indexed**). You can move **up**, **down**, **left**, or **right**, and you wish to find a route that requires the minimum **effort**.

A route's **effort** is the **maximum absolute difference** in heights between two consecutive cells of the route.

Return _the minimum **effort** required to travel from the top-left cell to the bottom-right cell._

**Example 1:**

**Input:** heights = \[\[1,2,2\],\[3,8,2\],\[5,3,5\]\]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** The route of \[1,3,5,3,5\] has a maximum absolute difference of 2 in consecutive cells.
This is better than the route of \[1,2,2,2,5\], where the maximum absolute difference is 3.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** heights = \[\[1,2,3\],\[3,8,4\],\[5,3,5\]\]
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** The route of \[1,2,3,4,5\] has a maximum absolute difference of 1 in consecutive cells, which is better than route \[1,3,5,3,5\].

**Example 3:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/04/ex3.png)

**Input:** heights = \[\[1,2,1,1,1\],\[1,2,1,2,1\],\[1,2,1,2,1\],\[1,2,1,2,1\],\[1,1,1,2,1\]\]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** This route does not require any effort.

**Constraints:**

*   `rows == heights.length`
*   `columns == heights[i].length`
*   `1 <= rows, columns <= 100`
*   `1 <= heights[i][j] <= 106`
