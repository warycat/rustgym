<div><p>Given a 2D grid, each cell is either a wall <code>'W'</code>, an enemy <code>'E'</code> or empty <code>'0'</code> (the number zero), return the maximum enemies you can kill using one bomb.<br>
The bomb kills all the enemies in the same row and column from the planted point until it hits the wall since the wall is too strong to be destroyed.<br>
<strong>Note: </strong>You can only put the bomb at an empty cell.</p>
