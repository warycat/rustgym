<div><p>Design a class which receives a list of words in the constructor, and implements a method that takes two words <em>word1</em> and <em>word2</em> and return the shortest distance between these two words in the list. Your method will be called <em>repeatedly</em> many times with different parameters.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
Assume that words = <code>["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"]</code>.</p>

<pre><b>Input:</b> <em>word1</em> = <code>“coding”</code>, <em>word2</em> = <code>“practice”</code>
<b>Output:</b> 3
</pre>

<pre><b>Input:</b> <em>word1</em> = <code>"makes"</code>, <em>word2</em> = <code>"coding"</code>
<b>Output:</b> 1</pre>

<p><strong>Note:</strong><br>
You may assume that <em>word1</em> <strong>does not equal to</strong> <em>word2</em>, and <em>word1</em> and <em>word2</em> are both in the list.</p>
