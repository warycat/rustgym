<div><p>Given a binary tree, you need to find the length of Longest Consecutive Path in Binary Tree.</p>

<p>Especially, this path can be either increasing or decreasing. For example, [1,2,3,4] and [4,3,2,1] are both considered valid, but the path [1,2,4,3] is not valid. On the other hand, the path can be in the child-Parent-child order, where not necessarily be parent-child order.</p>

<p><b>Example 1:</b></p>

<pre><b>Input:</b>
        1
       / \
      2   3
<b>Output:</b> 2
<b>Explanation:</b> The longest consecutive path is [1, 2] or [2, 1].
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Example 2:</b></p>

<pre><b>Input:</b>
        2
       / \
      1   3
<b>Output:</b> 3
<b>Explanation:</b> The longest consecutive path is [1, 2, 3] or [3, 2, 1].
</pre>

<p><b>Note:</b> All the values of tree nodes are in the range of [-1e7, 1e7].</p>
