<div><p>Given a set of words <b>(without duplicates)</b>, find all <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_square" target="_blank">word squares</a> you can build from them.</p>

<p>A sequence of words forms a valid word square if the <i>k</i><sup>th</sup> row and column read the exact same string, where 0 ≤ <i>k</i> &lt; max(numRows, numColumns).</p>

<p>For example, the word sequence <code>["ball","area","lead","lady"]</code> forms a word square because each word reads the same both horizontally and vertically.</p>

<pre>b a l l
a r e a
l e a d
l a d y
</pre>

<p><b>Note:</b><br>
</p><ol>
<li>There are at least 1 and at most 1000 words.</li>
<li>All words will have the exact same length.</li>
<li>Word length is at least 1 and at most 5.</li>
<li>Each word contains only lowercase English alphabet <code>a-z</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p></p>

<p><b>Example 1:</b>
</p><pre><b>Input:</b>
["area","lead","wall","lady","ball"]

<b>Output:</b>
[
  [ "wall",
    "area",
    "lead",
    "lady"
  ],
  [ "ball",
    "area",
    "lead",
    "lady"
  ]
]

<b>Explanation:</b>
The output consists of two word squares. The order of output does not matter (just the order of words in each word square matters).
